# Overview

This is a flash card app that was made using android studio. The language I used was Kotlin. I made this app so that I could learn the basics of how apps work and how they are made.

In this flash card app, there are several buttons and text boxes that the user can use to create and look through flash cards. Flash cards can be added by typing in the information that needs to be on the flash card and then clicking the "Add new flash card" button. Once flash cards have been created, the user can look through their cards by clicking the "Flip", "Next", and "Back" buttons in the app.

The purpose of creating this software was for me to learn more about moblie apps and what it takes to make an app.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Future Work

In the future, I would like to do the following to improve this app:
* Make it so that the app can remember flash cards even after the app is closed
* Make it so that you can have different groupings of flash cards for different subjects (Math, Science, etc.)
* Make it so that the app can randomly select flash cards instead of going in the same order that the flash cards were entered
